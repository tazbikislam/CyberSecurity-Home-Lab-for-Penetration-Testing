# Project: CyberSecurity Home Lab for Penetration Testing


## Overview
A personal allocated cybersecurity home lab built for a safe and controlled environment to conduct penetration testing.


## Setup

* Host Machine: Microsoft Windows 11 Home â€” 8GB RAM, 200GB storage disk allocated for project lab
* Virtual Machine: VirtualBox 7.1.8
* Attacker VM: Kali Linux 2025.2-installer-amd64
* Target VM(s):
  * Windows 10-x64
  * Metasploitable 2
* Tools Used:
  * Nmap
  * Metasploit
  * Wireshark


## Steps 

### Lab Setup

1. Installed VirtualBox and Initiated all virtual machines i.e Kali Linux, Windows 10, and vulnerable system (Metasploitable 2).
